This is a little MUSCLE bot that can be used to add a Message of the Day
to your MUSCLE server that BeShare clients will see.

To compile:
   1. Download the MUSCLE archive from BeBits (v2.30 or higher), and make
      sure the muscle folder appears in the same folder that the motdbot
      folder is.
 
   2. cd into this folder and type make

To run:
   1. Make sure muscled is running on your machine.

   2. cd into this folder and type ./motdbot

To change the text file:

   edit motd.txt with any text editor

To report problems:
